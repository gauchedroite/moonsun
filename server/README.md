moonsun - server
===

This is a plain Node Express server serving static content from the [public](../public) folder.

Later on I'll use this server only for a database backed game API. I then might remove serving static content from here.


Installation
---
```
npm install
npm start
```

Content will be served on port `1337` by default.
